<h5>Abstract
</h5>
<p>
In this project we were interested in studying the moral exclusion of
different animals and how this may be predicted by ideologically motivated
beliefs. Previous research found that stronger beliefs in human supremacy
over animals, and stronger perceived threat posed by vegetarianism to
traditional practices, are associated with stronger speciesism and more
meat consumption (Dhont &amp; Hodson, 2014). Both variables might also be
implicated in the moral exclusion of animals. We tested this in a 16-month
longitudinal study in the USA (N = 219) and in a cross-sectional study in
China (N = 242). Results found that human supremacy beliefs were
associated with the moral exclusion of all animal categories in both studies.
In Study 1 (but not Study 2) we also found that vegetarianism threat
predicted moral exclusion of food animals (e.g., cows and pigs), and,
unexpectedly, appealing wild animals (e.g., chimps and dolphins). These
findings demonstrate the importance of human supremacy beliefs in
explaining moral exclusion of all animals and highlight that in some cultures
vegetarianism threat may play a role in explaining the moral exclusion of
(some) animals.

<h5>Abstract
</h5>
<p>
Conservationists have sought to identify avenues through which to gain
public support for efforts to halt the accelerating decline in animal diversity.
Previous research has identified internal qualities of animals that lead
people to view them as deserving of protection for their own sake; that is,
increase their moral standing. In two studies, we found that beauty is an
external aesthetic quality that leads people to attribute moral standing to
animals independently from animals’ mental capacities associated
with patiency or agency, and dispositional harmfulness. In Study 1, we
found that beauty perceptions independently predicted moral standing
across a wide range of animal species from 12 biological categories. In
Study 2 (pre-registered), we found that beauty causally influenced moral
standing attributions to animals independently from animals’ internal
qualities. Our findings provide insight into another factor which contributes
to the perceived moral status of animals, and therefore may help
conservationists to identify the most effective ways to attract funds for
conservation efforts.

Presentation 3: Sharing reality with animals: Examples and

<h5>Abstract</h5>
<p>
Animal agriculture, a system that employs 1.3 billion people and results in
the slaughter of over one hundred billion animals each year, represents
perhaps the most profound intertwining of human and animal lives on the
planet. And yet, research on the human-animal relationships at the centre
of these systems has focused on only a narrow range of relationship states.
In this talk, we use Shared Reality as a framework to review the
scholarship in favour of expanding that range to include close,
intersubjective relationships. Looking toward traditions that encourage
learning from and taking the perspective of nonhuman animals, we provide
entry points into a discussion of the methods and advocacy that can close
the human-animal relational divide in agriculture. By showing that close
relationships are possible and likely of mutual benefit, this research
highlights an additional and underrecognized harm incurred by the
industrialization of our food systems.
