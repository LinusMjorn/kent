Abstract
</h5>

<p>
The empathy that most humans feel for animals, is hard to put into practise as long as people are “steakholders”. 
Individuals as well as society as a whole are heavily invested in and dependent on the use of animals for food. 
The animal advocacy movement is generally what we call (in a narrow sense) idealistic, wanting people to do the right thing for the right reasons.
 A pragmatic approach suggests that motivations for change don’t matter as much as we often think they do,
and that behavior change may often precede attitudinal change. If we can make people behave differently by making animal friendly alternatives still better and more easily available,
 we can make it easier for them to feel compassionate and to change their views about animals.
